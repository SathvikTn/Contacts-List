Contacts-List is a MEAN app i.e, MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.JS are the technologies used.

## Set-up MongoDB-
To set mongodb, refer this --> https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/ for windows. \n
Create D:\data\db folders
then in terminal, "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.4\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath="c:\data\db"
If the MongoDB database server is running correctly, the Command Interpreter displays:
[initandlisten] waiting for connections
